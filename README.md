## General Info

  Password Generator was built based on requirements provided in homework, in README section as well as based on start points in JavaScript.

## Specifics

  * Many different methods were approached while building password generator. Based on outcomes and mistakes, the code provided in JavaScript section appears to be the most convenient.

  * Class "btn" has to be fixed to "Btn" in html and css in order to "button" to reply on clicking.


## Deployment of application

## Comments

* Password Generator could be built using more advanced and cleaner coding. It would be possible after learning more about JavaScript.

* Checkboxes and triggers could be used instead of prompts
